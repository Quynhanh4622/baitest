    <h1 class="">Warm Destinations to Escape to in January</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>1. Tenerife, Canary Islands</h2>
    <p>Tenerife is the largest of Spain’s Canary Islands and doubles as a perfect break from a brutal winter. The average temperature here in January is around 21C/70F, and the sun is pretty much always shining. In fact, there’s so much sun that the Canary Islands have been affectionately coined “the baby Caribbean.” Tenerife is perfect for nature lovers, too. The island abounds with jagged cliffs, long scenic hiking trails and more lookout points than you can imagine.</p>
